# DataLoggerScreen
Arduino project logging Humidity, Temperate and combustible gas. A joystick navigates a complex menu so that more details and historical values can be found. All historical data is kept in SRAM.

[TODO: Screensaver showing photo of project]

# Screens
There are multiple screens, which are changed by using the Joystick.

## Dashboard
Shows summary of information, currently simple. Looking into scrolling the different values.

## Sensor details
Shows minimum, current and maximum sensor values.

## History (WIP)
